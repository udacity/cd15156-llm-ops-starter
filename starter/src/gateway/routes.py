"""HTTP API: POST /query, GET /health.

The ``/query`` handler composes the full LLM Ops stack the course teaches:
input guards (regex-based prompt-injection detection + PII redaction),
semantic cache lookup against the redacted question, the tiered model
router, and output guards (hallucination + off-topic). Cleaned questions
are cached only after passing the output guards. Blocked or filtered
requests return a safe ``QueryResponse`` with ``blocked_by`` set.

Layer-by-layer alternates (``guarded_route_query``, ``cached_route_query``,
the LLM-Guard variant) remain available as standalone wrappers for tests
and for module-by-module exploration in the curriculum.

    The handler intentionally inlines the layer composition rather than
    delegating to a single wrapper, because seeing the order of layers at
    the HTTP boundary is part of the lesson:

    1. ``detect_prompt_injection`` — short-circuits to a safe response on
       match. The LLM is never called for blocked input.
    2. ``detect_pii`` — redacts emails, phone numbers, SSNs, credit cards.
       The redacted text is what flows downstream; raw PII never reaches
       the cache, the LLM, or the tracing backend.
    3. ``cache_lookup`` — returns a cached ``QueryResponse`` if the
       embedding is within the similarity threshold of a prior query.
    4. ``route_query`` — classify simple/complex, dispatch to the right
       model, run the traced RAG pipeline, log per-request cost.
    5. ``check_hallucination`` and ``is_off_topic`` — output guards that
       block answers citing nonexistent products or veering off-topic.
       A flagged response is **not** cached.
    6. ``cache_store`` — persist the (cleaned-question, response) pair
       only after the output guards pass.

    Standalone wrappers (``guarded_route_query`` in ``src.guardrails`` and
    ``cached_route_query`` in ``src.cache``) compose the same pieces in
    isolation; they remain for tests and module-by-module exploration.
